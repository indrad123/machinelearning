# Evaluation of Assignment 2

Assignment 2 has a shorter period. A few things were observed during assignment 2 that need improvement.

1. Time management is another issue similar to assignment 1.
2. After finishing assignment 1, we didn't start immediately for the 2nd assignment, so causing unable to improve the quality. Again, this should be solved by good time management.
3. Need more powerful hardware to do the training, because, on many occasions, the training failed and crashed the system, because of limited resources.
